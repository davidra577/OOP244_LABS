Workshop 1 Reflection OOP244NEE
Date: OCT 3rd 2020

During the Workshop 1 of OOP 244, I learned how to create individual modules and header files in the C++ language. 
Header files were used to declare function prototypes. By creating individual modules and various header files, they can be used potentially in another program.
Overall, using header files has helped me to organize and vastly improved the modularity of the program.

Since C++ is an extension of C programming language, I was able to use my previous knowledge of C programming language from IPC144 to help and familiarize myself with the basic C++ code and the g++ compiler on Seneca matrix.
One of the new essential topics that I have learned is to utilize namespaces in C++ programming. 
The purpose of namespace was to create a separate group of names of variables. This allowed me to use the same variable names in a different module and avoid duplicating names between variables of the same name. 
I have learned the new type “bool,” and “auto." The type “bool” was used to store a true/false value. 
The type “Auto” was used in place of a type when initializing and it determines the type of variable automatically.
