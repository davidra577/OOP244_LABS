Workshop 3 Reflection OOP244

In Workshop 3 of OOP244, I learned how to create member and member functions and utilized the public and private access levels.
I also learned about Input / Cin and Out / Cout functions, the usage, and some public member functions of cout and cin functions.

Member functions have an association with an object.
There are three main types of member functions which are Queries, Modifiers, and Special.
The member functions have direct access to the object's data.

For example, from Lab 3 Part 2 of Bar.h File:

	class Bar {
		char title[20 + 1];
		char a;
		int barValue;
		bool validStatus;
	public:
		void setEmpty();
		void set(const char* name, char ch, int value);
		bool getValid(int value);
		void draw()const;
	};
	
The Bar member has been created with private variables of barValue, validStatus, a, and title[20+1].
The public functions within the Bar are setEmpty(), set(const char* name, char ch, int value), getValid(int value), and draw().
When defining a member function such as setEmpty(), you must specify the scope affiliation of the member function.
An example would be "void Bar::setEmpty()."
When working within a memberfunction, it is similar to working within a local scope.
Thus by having the same scope within a member class, you can have direct access to any of the data and functions.

I learned how to utilize cout/cin input and output functions as well as using their public member functions.
Cout object is an ostream type. It also has public member functions such as width, fill, and more.
From Lab 3, part2 Bar.cpp file:
cout.width(20); cout.fill('.'); cout << left << title;
I have used width(), fill() and left public member functions.
This displays the "title" variable from starting from left, with the size with a maximum of 20 characters "cout.width(20)", and all of the empty fields left with being filled with asterisk * symbol "cout.fill('.')".
This allows us to trim down coding and easier time formatting the output.
