Workshop 4 Reflection OOP244
Date: Oct 18th 2020

In Workshop 4 of OOP244, I learned how to create constructors, destructors, and overloading constructors.
I have also learned how to call upon a current object by using this keyword.

For example, from Lab 4 Part 2 of NameTag.h File:

	public:
		NameTag();
		~NameTag();
		NameTag(const char* name);
		NameTag(const char* name, int num);
		void print();
		NameTag& read();
		void flushkeys();
		bool yes();

From NameTag.cpp File:
	NameTag::NameTag()
	{
		m_name = nullptr;
		m_extNum = 0;
	}

	NameTag::~NameTag() 
	{
		delete[] m_name;
		m_name = nullptr;
	}
	
The declaration of default constructor function is NameTag().
The default constructor consists of a zero-argument/parameter and does not have any return type.
The destructor is "~NameTag()", it has no return type as well as no argument/parameter.
Having constructors help to set the object's empty state and any other preliminary behaviour at creation time. 
The destructors handle objects that reach the end of their lifetime and handles the deallocation of memory for dynamically allocated resources for an object.

Thus, the constructor NameTag(), initialize the m_name char* array as nullptr and sets m_extNum as 0.
The destructor deallocates dynamically allocated char* array "m_name" at the end of the program using FILO (first in, last out) mechanism.

The functions "NameTag(const char* name)" and "NameTag(const char* name, int num)" represent overloading constructors, which can safely create the objects.

I have also learned how to refer to the current object by using "*this."
The keyword is used to refer to the memory in the current object when you are within the member function.

From workshop 4, NameTag.cpp file:

NameTag& NameTag::read() 
{
		...
		...
		strcpy(m_name, temp);
		m_extNum = tempNum;
		return *this;
}


This function returns the current object to one of the member functions.
In workshop 5, this function returns the current object to print() in nametagMain.cpp File.

This workshop forced me to all knowledge and information taught during lab 1 to 4 to complete it.
I had to utilize input/output, dynamic memory allocation and memory cleanup, constructor/destructor, cout formatting, and utilizing Classes.
